					<description><![CDATA[&#8220;Why are toxic chemicals are toxic to the body if ingested but not toxic when used in a vaccine?&#8221;Part 2: How do Vaccines work?When your body detects a &#8220;foreign protein&#8221; (aka virus poop), it will create Warriors called Cytokines specifically tailored to fight them. Unfortunately, this takes time. Lots and lots of time.

					<description><![CDATA[When you catch the Flu, the virus particles will replicate billions and billions of times, and you won&#8217;t feel sick until they&#8217;ve replicated millions of times after a few days. When viruses reproduce, they poop out toxic proteins generally specific to each virus. Think of how cat and dog and human poop smells slightly different? &#8230; <p class="link-more"><a href="/home/2020/05/11/how-does-a-virus-produce-toxins-in-your-body-and-how-does-your-body-respond/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "How does a Virus produce toxins in your body and how does your body respond?"</span></a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as nCov-2019) coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, is currently racing around the planet. This SARS v2.0 Coronavirus is unlike any pathogen we as humans have ever experienced, certainly in the last 2,000+ years, but probably in our entire history as a species. Here is why: Covid-19 Coronavirus is Different 1. &#8230; <p class="link-more"><a href="/home/2020/03/15/how-we-know-covid-19-is-an-engineered-coronavirus/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "How We Know COVID-19 is an Engineered Coronavirus"</span></a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are right now possibly four major strains of Covid-19 coronavirus (Strain S and Strain L have been confirmed by China). There were 118 mutated minor strains as of 7 March in just the USA alone. The idea that a vaccine will be ready is laughable because the HIV vaccine (also an RNA virus) has &#8230; <p class="link-more"><a href="/home/2020/03/11/why-a-vaccine-for-covid-19-coronavirus-is-unlikely/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "Why a Vaccine for Covid-19 Coronavirus is Unlikely"</span></a></p>]]></description>

It is a colony of 15 million fruit bats. The same kind of bat that is used around the world in biomedical research and bioweapon development. &#8230; <p class="link-more"><a href="/home/2020/03/11/the-bats-bracken-tx-near-san-antonio-may-kill-us-all/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "The Bats @ Bracken, TX, near San Antonio, May Doom Us All"</span></a></p>]]></description>

Only that our governments across the world — including paragons of freedom of thought&#160;— are lying to us.
