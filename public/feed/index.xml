Unfortunately, this takes time. Lots and lots of time.

					<description><![CDATA[When you catch the Flu, the virus particles will replicate billions and billions of times, and you won&#8217;t feel sick until they&#8217;ve replicated millions of times after a few days. When viruses reproduce, they poop out toxic proteins generally specific to each virus. Think of how cat and dog and human poop smells slightly different? &#8230; <p class="link-more"><a href="/home/2020/05/11/how-does-a-virus-produce-toxins-in-your-body-and-how-does-your-body-respond/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "How does a Virus produce toxins in your body and how does your body respond?"</span></a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as nCov-2019) coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, is currently racing around the planet. This SARS v2.0 Coronavirus is unlike any pathogen we as humans have ever experienced, certainly in the last 2,000+ years, but probably in our entire history as a species.

There were 118 mutated minor strains as of 7 March in just the USA alone. The idea that a vaccine will be ready is laughable because the HIV vaccine (also an RNA virus) has &#8230; <p class="link-more"><a href="/home/2020/03/11/why-a-vaccine-for-covid-19-coronavirus-is-unlikely/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "Why a Vaccine for Covid-19 Coronavirus is Unlikely"</span></a></p>]]></description>
